# MICROSERVICES
- Advisory lock Pattern
- Chassis Pattern - https://dzone.com/articles/ms-chassis-pattern
- Choreography vs Orchestration - https://solace.com/blog/microservices-choreography-vs-orchestration/

# DDD
- Context Map - "Design By Protection"
- Aggregate root isn't entity is a use case - https://udidahan.com/2009/06/29/dont-create-aggregate-roots/
- for the partition of aggregation (https://www.alibabacloud.com/blog/an-in-depth-understanding-of-aggregation-in-domain-driven-design_598034)
- consistency of scenario frequency (https://www.alibabacloud.com/blog/an-in-depth-understanding-of-aggregation-in-domain-driven-design_598034)
- EVENT SOURCING is a storage design pattern
- CQRS  is an application/architecture pattern focused around how to pipeline your code

## VALIDATION
- https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/microservices/microservice-ddd-cqrs-patterns/domain-model-layer-validations

# EVENTSTORMING
- Pivot Events

# EVENTSOURCING 
- Actor model 

# CQRS
- Many people have been getting confused over what CQRS is. They look at CQRS as being an architecture; it is not. CQRS is a very 
  simple pattern that enables many opportunities for architecture that may otherwise not exist.
