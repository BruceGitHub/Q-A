# CQRS
- https://danielwhittaker.me/2014/11/15/aggregate-root-cqrs-event-sourcing/
- https://tsh.io/blog/cqrs-event-sourcing-php/

- Many people have been getting confused over what CQRS is. They look at CQRS as being an architecture; it is not. CQRS is a very 
  simple pattern that enables many opportunities for architecture that may otherwise not exist.

- consistency of scenario frequency (https://www.alibabacloud.com/blog/an-in-depth-understanding-of-aggregation-in-domain-driven-design_598034)
- EVENT SOURCING is a storage design pattern
- CQRS  is an application/architecture pattern focused around how to pipeline your code
