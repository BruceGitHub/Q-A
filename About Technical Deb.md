# Type of debt 

![](https://corgibytes.com/uploads/2020-02-12-technical-debt.jpeg)

- CODE | SOFTWARE DEBT: When code is hard to change and deploy, you’re not maximizing your productivity.
    - CODE COMPLEXITY: Cyclomatic complexity. The more paths a chunk of code has, the more difficult it is for a human to interpret and the more tests are required if a change needs to be mad (4 is good, between 5 and 7 is complex, between 8 and 10 is high)
    
    - LACK OF AUTOMATED TESTS: for the evolution 
    - TECHNICAL DEBT
    - QUALITY DEBT

    - CODE LEGIBILITY: 
    - DOMAIN CLARITY:


- ORGANIZATION DEBT:
    - The architecture of a codebase is bound to be a mirror image of the communication structures that are set up by the organization that builds it. (Conway’s Law)
    - CULTURAL ALIGNMENT: **if your culture doesn’t support interpersonal risk taking, a team member with valuable insight may hold back and not share even if they’ve spotted a flaw that could have saved the team hours of collective work.**

# General Note 
-  One more way that teams can help is to define which software quality attributes should be a focus from the technical perspective of a particular application under development and also understand which attributes the project stakeholders are most interested in. From this, both perspectives can be discussed and a small amount of software quality attributes, rather than every potential type of quality, can be integrated and focused on during development.
