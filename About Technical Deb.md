- CODE DEBT: When code is hard to change and deploy, youâ€™re not maximizing your productivity.
    - CODE COMPLEXITY: Cyclomatic complexity. The more paths a chunk of code has, the more difficult it is for a human to interpret and the more tests are required if a change needs to be mad (4 is good, between 5 and 7 is complex, between 8 and 10 is high)
    
    - LACK OF AUTOMATED TESTS: for the evolution 

- COMMUNICATION DEBT: 
    -Commit messages (with detailed descriptions!)
    - Pull/Merge Request comments
    - README files
    - Wikis and other internal documentation
    - Logging
