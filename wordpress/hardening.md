>Qualities of a trusted web host might include:
Readily discusses your security concerns and which security features and processes they offer with their hosting.
Provides the most recent stable versions of all server software.
Provides reliable methods for backup and recovery.

## Second the application
> To understand where and why this is important you must understand how websites get hacked, Rarely is it attributed to the infrastructure, and most often attributed to the application itself (i.e., the environment you are responsible for).

## Two-step authentication** as an additional security measure.
