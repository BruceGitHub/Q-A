## note
### The aggregate breaks the fluidity with the ubiquitous language because it's a technical aspect 
### Link the data with the changes, so the behaviors, then name the aggregate
### Remodelling the aggregate is dangerous and onerous
### Events as pure fact not techical concepts 
### Query the domain events 
### Conditionals updates 

## note+
### We should think to this approach
