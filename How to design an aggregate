Main topics:
  - Consistency of the -lifecycle
  - Consistency of the problem domain
  - Consistency of the scenario frequency
  - As few elements as possible within the aggregation

Separate data from behavior, so two-class data, one class only with data  for the ORM one form Method. 
Without ORM obviously, we need to implement the dirty check pattern a manner is with events

Design around the behaviour. 
Domain expert trap, the domain expert gives some indications upon on its point of view. This isn't the direct "artifact" that go in the code solution

- Nick Chamberlain - 

Suggests to use a factory to create an AggregateRoot, in particular, suggest to use `ubiquitous language` not `create` for example but `hire` `customer`

- Martin Fowler - https://martinfowler.com/bliki/DDD_Aggregate.html

>Any references from outside the aggregate should only go to the aggregate root. The root can thus ensure the integrity of the aggregate as a whole.

# What means transactional boundary 
wip 

# My answer:
First, the transaction boundary rule for the aggregate isn't a rule is 
good guidelines, suggestions.
The origin of this is 
- to void to load more data from the DB, 
- to avoid the problem of the lock from the persistent layer.
- to keep the concept simple and testable 

In fact, in past was common practice to persist a huge quantity of data, into the persistent layer, 
so more locks and more failed transactions, when workload increased
