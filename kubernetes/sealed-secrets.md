# Vault

Disadvantages
- Since it unseals the sealed secrets into regular secrets, you can still decode them if you have access to the cluster and namespace.
- Requires resealing for each cluster environment, as the key pair will be unique for each cluster.

```txt
- the SealedSecret and Secret must have the same namespace and name. This is a feature to prevent other users on the same cluster from re-using your sealed secrets
- Sealing key renewal: Sealed secrets are not automatically rotated and old keys are not deleted when new keys are generated. Old sealed secrets resources can be still decrypted (thatâ€™s because old sealing keys are not deleted).
- The sealing key renewal and SealedSecret rotation are not a substitute for rotating your actual secrets.
- Needs CRS for custom resource SealedSecret
- Needs kubeseal client side binary to encrypt secret
- sealed-secret.yaml keep with other manifest in git, secret.yaml can be deleted because it never used.
- It is not support external secret store like Vault, Cloud Provider Services (KMS, SSM, Azure Keyvault etc.)
